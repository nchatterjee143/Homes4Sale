# Instructions #

In order to run this project, you must keep file in the repository in the same directory when you attempt to run Homes4Sale.java. This ensures that everything will be read properly. There is only one class that needs to be run in this case, and that is Homes4Sale.java. However, to ensure that the class passes all the test cases, you may also run RunLocalTest.java
+ NOTE 1: When trying to create a new property as a seller, please ensure that there are no commas when setting any of the entries the program will ask you. For example, when asked for a description of the house you are selling, enter "3 bed 2 bath" instead of "3 bed, 2 bath"
+ NOTE 2: Please ensure there is at least 1 property in marketplace.txt before trying to act as a buyer.
